# LumiNixie Arduino

## Uploading

The software uses SPIFFS, so make sure that it's available by setting the appropriate flash size in Arduino.
You can find this setting in the Arduino menu under "Tools" -> "Flash Size".
For example: select `4M (1M SPIFFS)`.

Use https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin to upload the files in `/data` to the SPIFFS.

## Running

On startup, the software will try to connect to a WiFi network.
When connecting to the network does not succeed within 15 seconds,
an accesspoint (WiFi network) will be started. It's SSID will be
something like `luminixie-XXXX`.
You can connect to that accesspoint from your computer, use password `luminixie`.

Get the current configuration from http://luminixie/configuration using a GET request.
The configuration is a json document.

Change `wifiSsid` and `wifiPassword` and send the json to http://luminixie/configuration using a POST request.
The ESP-8266 (or whatever board you run) will restart and try to connect to the configured WiFi network.
